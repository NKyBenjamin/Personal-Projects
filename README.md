This folder is simply for personal projects, where I create things for myself just to make things more convenient! Feel free to test them out!!

<h1>Configurations for the Shutdown Scheduler:</h1>

If you want this executable to **open every time you start your computer**, simply press **Win + R** and type in "**shell:startup**", and be sure to **copy and paste the executable into that folder**, and then you will be able to **enable and disable it in Task Manager Startup Tab**!

If you want to **cancel the scheduler**, you will also have to go into **Task Manager** and **search up "TheShutdownScheduler" to find it and shut it off!**
